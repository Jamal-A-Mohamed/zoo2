(2007) were able to report it from the wild.\n\n\n== Geographic range ==\nMcCord's box turtle is endemic to central Guangxi province, China.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nC. mccordi is one of the most endangered Chinese endemic turtle species, highly sought after for traditional Chinese medicine and by turtle hobbyists.\n\n\n== Description ==\nOnce thought to reach only 14 cm (5.5 in) straight carapace length, specimens of McCord's box turtle of up to 18 cm (7.1 in) straight carapace length are known now.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nERNST CH (1988). \"Cuora mccordi, a new Chinese box turtle from Guangxi Province\".
