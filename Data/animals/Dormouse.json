    "BriefSummary": "A dormouse is a rodent of the family Gliridae (this family is also variously called Myoxidae or Muscardinidae by different taxonomists). Dormice are mostly found in Europe, although some species live in Africa or Asia. A nocturnal animal, dormice are particularly known for their long periods of hibernation.As only one species of dormouse is native to the British Isles, the hazel dormouse, in everyday English usage \"dormouse\" can refer either to that one species or to the family as a whole.\nThe English name of the species derived from the French dormeuse, and the latter in turn possibly from the Languedocien radourmeire.",
    "WikiContents": "A dormouse is a rodent of the family Gliridae (this family is also variously called Myoxidae or Muscardinidae by different taxonomists). Dormice are mostly found in Europe, although some species live in Africa or Asia. A nocturnal animal, dormice are particularly known for their long periods of hibernation.As only one species of dormouse is native to the British Isles, the hazel dormouse, in everyday English usage \"dormouse\" can refer either to that one species or to the family as a whole.\nThe English name of the species derived from the French dormeuse, and the latter in turn possibly from the Languedocien radourmeire.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nConcerning the dormouse's name, etymonline says \"long-tailed Old World rodent noted for its state of semi-hibernation in winter, early 15c., possibly from Anglo-French *dormouse \"tending to be dormant\" (from stem of dormir \"to sleep,\" see dormant), with the second element mistaken for mouse; or perhaps it is from a Middle English dialectal compound of mouse (n.) and Middle French dormir. French dormeuse, fem. of dormeur \"sleeper\" is attested only from 17c.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nDormice are small rodents, with body lengths between 6 and 19 cm (2.4 and 7.5 in), and weights between 15 and 180 g (0.53 and 6.35 oz). They are generally mouse-like in appearance, but with furred, rather than scaly, tails. They are largely arboreal, agile, and well adapted to climbing. Most species are nocturnal. Dormice have an excellent sense of hearing and signal each other with a variety of vocalisations.Dormice are omnivorous, typically feeding on fruits, berries, flowers, nuts, and insects. They are unique among rodents in that they lack a cecum, a part of the gut used in other species to ferment vegetable matter. Their dental formula is similar to that of squirrels, although they often lack premolars:\n\nDormice breed once or occasionally twice each year, producing litters with an average of four young after a gestation period of 22\u201324 days. They can live for as long as five years. The young are born hairless and helpless, and their eyes do not open until about 18 days after birth. They typically become sexually mature after the end of their first hibernation. Dormice live in small family groups, with home ranges that vary widely between species and depend on the availability of food.\n\n\n=== Hibernation ===\nOne of the most notable characteristics of those dormice that live in temperate zones is hibernation. They can hibernate six months out of the year, or even longer if the weather does not become warm enough, sometimes waking for brief periods to eat food they had previously stored nearby. During the summer, they accumulate fat in their bodies to nourish them through the hibernation period.The sleepy behaviour of the dormouse character in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland reflects this familiar trait of dormice.\n\n\n== Relationship with humans ==\nThe edible dormouse (Glis glis) was considered a delicacy in ancient Rome, either as a savoury appetizer or as a dessert (dipped in honey and poppy seeds). The Romans used a special kind of enclosure, a glirarium, to raise dormice for the table. It is still considered a delicacy in Slovenia and in several places in Croatia, namely Lika, and the islands of Hvar and Bra\u010d. Dormouse fat was believed by the Elizabethans to induce sleep since the animal put on fat before hibernating.In more recent years dormice have begun to enter the pet trade, though they are uncommon as pets and are considered an exotic pet. The woodland dormouse (Graphiurus murinus) is the most commonly seen species in the pet trade. Asian garden dormice (Eliomys melanurus) are also occasionally kept as pets.\n\n\n== Evolution ==\nThe Gliridae are one of the oldest extant rodent families, with a fossil record dating back to the early Eocene. As currently understood, they descended in Europe from early Paleogene ischyromyids such as Microparamys (Sparnacomys) chandoni. The early and middle Eocene genus Eogliravus represents the earliest and most primitive glirid taxon; the oldest species, Eogliravus wildi, is known from isolated teeth from the early Eocene of France and a complete specimen of the early middle Eocene of the Messel pit in Germany. They appear in Africa in the upper Miocene and only relatively recently in Asia. Many types of extinct dormouse species have been identified. During the Pleistocene, giant dormice the size of large rats, such as Leithia melitensis, lived on the islands of Malta and Sicily.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nThe family consists of 29 living species, in three subfamilies and (arguably) nine genera:\nFamily Gliridae \u2013 Dormice\n\nSubfamily Graphiurinae\nGenus Graphiurus, African dormice\nAngolan African dormouse, Graphiurus angolensis\nChristy's dormouse, Graphiurus christyi\nJentink's dormouse, Graphiurus crassicaudatus\nJohnston's African dormouse, Graphiurus johnstoni\nKellen's dormouse, Graphiurus kelleni\nLorrain dormouse, Graphiurus lorraineus\nSmall-eared dormouse, Graphiurus microtis\nMonard's dormouse, Graphiurus monardi\nWoodland dormouse, Graphiurus murinus\nNagtglas's African dormouse, Graphiurus nagtglasii\nSpectacled dormouse, Graphiurus ocularis\nRock dormouse, Graphiurus platyops\nStone dormouse, Graphiurus rupicola\nSilent dormouse, Graphiurus surdus\nGraphiurus walterverheyeni \nSubfamily Leithiinae\nGenus Chaetocauda\nChinese dormouse, Chaetocauda sichuanensis\nGenus Dryomys\nWoolly dormouse, Dryomys laniger\nBalochistan forest dormouse, Dryomys niethammeri\nForest dormouse, Dryomys nitedula\nGenus Eliomys, garden dormice\nAsian garden dormouse, Eliomys melanurus\nMaghreb garden dormouse, Eliomys munbyanus\nGarden dormouse, Eliomys quercinus\nGenus Hypnomys\u2020 (Balearic dormouse)\nMajorcan giant dormouse, Hypnomys morphaeus\u2020\nMinorcan giant dormouse, Hypnomys mahonensis\u2020\nGenus  Leithia\u2020\nMaltese giant dormouse, Leithia melitensis\u2020\nLeithia cartei\u2020\nGenus Muscardinus\nHazel dormouse, Muscardinus avellanarius\nGenus Myomimus, mouse-tailed dormice\nMasked mouse-tailed dormouse, Myomimus personatus\nRoach's mouse-tailed dormouse, Myomimus roachi\nSetzer's mouse-tailed dormouse, Myomimus setzeri\nGenus Selevinia\nDesert dormouse, Selevinia betpakdalaensis\nSubfamily Glirinae\nGenus Glirulus\nJapanese dormouse, Glirulus japonicus\nGenus Glis\nEdible dormouse, Glis glis\n\n\n=== Fossil species ===\nSubfamily Bransatoglirinae\nGenus Oligodyromys\nGenus Bransatoglis\nBransatoglis adroveri Majorca, Early Oligocene\nBransatoglis planus Eurasia, Early Oligocene\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHolden, M.
