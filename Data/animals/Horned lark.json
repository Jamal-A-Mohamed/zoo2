    "WikiContents": "The horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), called the shore lark in Europe, is a species of lark in the Alaudidae family found across the northern hemisphere.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and systematics ==\nThe specific alpestris is Latin and means \"of the high mountains\", from Alpes, the Alps.The horned lark was originally classified in the genus Alauda.

Found in south-western and south-central China\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nUnlike most other larks, this is a distinctive-looking species on the ground, mainly brown-grey above and pale below, with a striking black and yellow face pattern. Except for the central feathers, the tail is mostly black, contrasting with the paler body; this contrast is especially noticeable when the bird is in flight. The summer male has black \"horns\", which give this species its American name. North America has a number of races distinguished by the face pattern and back colour of males, especially in summer. The southern European mountain race E. a. penicillata is greyer above, and the yellow of the face pattern is replaced with white.\n\nVocalizations are high-pitched, lisping or tinkling, and weak. The song, given in flight as is common among larks, consists of a few chips followed by a warbling, ascending trill.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThe horned lark breeds across much of North America from the high Arctic south to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, northernmost Europe and Asia and in the mountains of south-east Europe. There is also an isolated population on a plateau in Colombia. It is mainly resident in the south of its range, but northern populations of this passerine bird are migratory, moving further south in winter.\nThis is a bird of open ground. In Eurasia it breeds above the tree line in mountains and the far north. In most of Europe, it is most often seen on seashore flats in winter, leading to the European name. In the UK it can be found as a winter stopover along the coasts and in eastern England. In North America, where there are no other larks to compete with, it is also found on farmland, on prairies, in deserts, on golf courses and airports.\n\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\n\nThe nest is on the ground, with two to five eggs being laid. Food is seeds supplemented with insects in the breeding season. The nest may be near corn or soybeans for a source of food, and the female chooses the site. The structure of Horned Lark nests can vary depending on the microclimate, prevailing weather and predation risk, revealing flexibility in nesting behaviour to adjust to changing environmental conditions to maintain nest survival and nestling size development.\n\n\n== Status and conservation ==\nIn the open areas of western North America, horned larks are among the bird species most often killed by wind turbines. In 2013, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the subspecies streaked horned lark as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nvan den Berg, Arnoud (2005) Morphology of Atlas Horned Lark Dutch Birding 27(4):256\u20138\nSmall, Brian (2002) The Horned Lark on the Isles of Scilly Birding World 15(3): 111\u201320 (discusses a possible Nearctic race bird on the Isles of Scilly in 2001)\nDickinson, E.C.; R.W.R.J.
