    "WikiContents": "Pituophis is a genus of nonvenomous colubrid snakes commonly referred to as gopher snakes, pine snakes, and bullsnakes, which are endemic to North America.\n\n\n== Geographic range ==\nSpecies and subspecies within the genus Pituophis are found throughout Mexico, the Southern and Western United States and Western Canada.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAll species of Pituophis are large and powerfully built. The head is relatively small in proportion to the body and it is only slightly distinct from the neck. The rostral is enlarged and elongated, imparting a characteristic somewhat pointed shape to the head. All the species occurring in the United States have four prefrontals instead of the usual two.\n\n\n== Modified epiglottis ==\nIn all snakes of the genus Pituophis, the epiglottis is peculiarly modified so that it is thin, erect and flexible. When a stream of air is forced from the trachea, the epiglottis vibrates, thereby producing the peculiarly loud, hoarse hissing for which bullsnakes, gopher snakes and pine snakes are well known.\n\n\n== Species and subspecies ==\nP. catenifer (Blainville, 1835) \u2013 gopher snake\nP. c. affinis (Hallowell, 1852) \u2013 Sonoran gopher snake\nP. c. annectens Baird & Girard, 1853 \u2013 San Diego gopher snake\nP. c. bimaris Klauber, 1946 \u2013 central Baja California gopher snake\nP. c. catenifer (Blainville, 1835) \u2013 Pacific gopher snake\nP. c. coronalis Klauber, 1946 \u2013 Coronado Island gopher snake\nP. c. deserticola Stejneger, 1893 \u2013 Great Basin gopher snake\nP. c. fulginatus Klauber, 1946 \u2013 San Martin Island gopher snake\nP. c. pumilis Klauber, 1946 \u2013 Santa Cruz gopher snake\nP. c. sayi (Schlegel, 1837) \u2013 bullsnake\nP. deppei (A.M.C.
