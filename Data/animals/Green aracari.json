Alternate names include Sclater's Ara\u00e7ari. The species is named for the green feathers covering its back.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMales' crowns are black, while females' are reddish brown.\n\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\n\n\n=== Breeding ===\nBreeding occurs from February to June.  It nests in tree cavities, producing 2\u20134 white eggs. The parents cooperate in rearing their young.\n\n\n=== Food and feeding ===\nIts diet consists mostly of fruit, including the fruits of Cecropia trees and the palm Oenocarpus bacaba. The serrated edges of the green aracari's large bill help the bird to grip and gather fruit. Insects are also an occasional part of the diet, giving the birds protein.\n\n\n== Pets ==\nIn captivity it is the most frequently bred member of the toucan family and is the most popular as a tame hand-fed pet. It requires a large cage and toys to prevent boredom due to its active nature, and a high-fruit diet. When all these requirements are met it is an affectionate companion for many years.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Pteroglossus viridis at Wikimedia Commons\nGreen aracari videos on the Internet Bird Collection\nStamps (for Guyana, Suriname) with ~RangeMap\nGreen aracari photo gallery at VIREO (Drexel University)\nPhoto-Medium Res; Article nashvillezoo\u2014\"Ramphastidae\"\nPhoto-High Res; Article & synopsis w/systematics arthurgrosset",
