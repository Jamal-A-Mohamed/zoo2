    "BriefSummary": "Gallicolumba is a mid-sized genus of ground-dwelling doves (family Columbidae) which occur in rainforests on the Philippines, Indonesia, and in the Pacific region. They are not closely related to the American ground doves (genus Columbina). Rather, the present genus is closest to the thick-billed ground dove.\nThis genus includes the bleeding-hearts known from the Philippines. Most are named for their vivid-red patch on the breast, which looks startlingly like a bleeding wound in some species and has reminded naturalists of a dagger stab. The diet of doves of this genus consists of fruits and seed.",
