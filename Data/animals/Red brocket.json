    "BriefSummary": "The red brocket (Mazama americana) is a species of brocket deer from forests in South America, ranging from northern Argentina to Colombia and the Guianas. It also occurs on the island of Trinidad in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (it also occurred on the island of Tobago until very recent historical times, but appears to have been extirpated there due to ineffectively regulated  hunting of wild game practiced on the island).\nIt formerly included the Central American red brocket (M. temama) and sometimes the Yucatan brown brocket (M. pandora) as subspecies. Considerable taxonomic confusion still exists for the populations remaining in the red brocket. Pending a solution to this, it has been evaluated as data deficient by the IUCN, though as presently defined, it is the most widespread species of brocket. It is sympatric with the smaller Amazonian brown brocket over much of its range (the latter tends to have significantly lower population densities). The karyotype of the red brocket was initially described as having 2n = 68, FN = 74, and more recently as having 2n varying from 48 to 54 and FN varying from 54 to 56. This variability may indicate the presence of unrecognized species in the population.Its body is reddish-brown in color, with a lighter grayish-brown head and neck, and partially blackish legs. The inner thighs and the underside of the tail are white. Fawns are spotted white and lack blackish to the legs. Only the adult male has antlers, and these are small and spike-like. This species is the largest of the brockets. The shoulder height is 67\u201380 cm (26\u201331 in) and the head and body length 105\u2013144 cm (41\u201357 in). These deer typically weigh 24\u201348 kg (53\u2013106 lb), but exceptional males may get as large as 65 kg (143 lb).The red brocket browses on vegetation, preferring fruit when it is available. It is generally solitary and stays in dense jungles. When alarmed, the animal snorts or stomps its hooves.",
