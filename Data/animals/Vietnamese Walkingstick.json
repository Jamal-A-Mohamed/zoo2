    "WikiContents": "Medauroidea extradentata, commonly known as the Vietnamese or Annam walking stick, is a species of the family Phasmatidae. They originate in Vietnam and are commonly found in tropical forests there. They eat a variety of foliage, though in captivity they commonly eat blackberry bramble, hawthorn, oak, red maple and rose.\n\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nVietnamese walking sticks are approximately 4-5 inches (10\u201312 cm) in length. Their heads are elongated and oval shaped with thread-like antennae. Their chewing mouthparts are specially adapted for eating plant material. Along its thorax are a number of small pointed bumps. Their middle set of legs show small flanges and minute spikes. These walking sticks are brownish in color and have six legs, which is a characteristic of all insects. Both male and female Vietnamese walking sticks have no wings.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\nMedauroidea extradentata is mainly parthenogenetic, meaning they are asexual, making males very rare in the species. The female drops hundreds of eggs onto the forest floor, these eggs hatch in a few months. The eggs of this species are mottled with black and white and capped with black.\n\n\n== Life cycle ==\nThe Vietnamese walking stick is short lived, living between 5\u20137 months. Nymphs look nearly identical to their parents except in size. They molt about 6 times before they become adults. At 3 months of age they become able to reproduce. Their main predators are birds and small mammals, though their camouflage helps them combat this.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nStephanie Boucher, Hirondelle Varady-Szabo (2005). \"Effects of Different Diets on the Survival, Longevity and Growth Rate of the Annam Stick Insect, Medauroidea extradentata (Phasmatodea: Phasmatidae)\".
