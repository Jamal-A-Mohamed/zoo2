    "BriefSummary": "The phascogales (members of the eponymous genus Phascogale), also known as wambengers, are carnivorous Australian marsupials of the family Dasyuridae. There are three species: the brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa), the red-tailed phascogale (Phascogale calura), and the northern brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale pirata). As with a number of dasyurid species, the males live for only one year, dying after a period of frenzied mating. The term Phascogale was coined in 1824 by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in reference to the brush-tailed phascogale, and means \"pouched weasel\". All three species are listed as either Near Threatened or Vulnerable by the IUCN.",

All males die soon after mating. Females give birth to about 6 young ones about 30 days after mating. Phascogales do not have the true pouch that is found in most other marsupials [1][2].   Instead, they form temporary folds of skin - sometimes called a \"pseudo-pouch\" [3] around the mammary glands during pregnancy.  Young stay in this pseudo-pouch area, nursing for about 7 weeks before being moved to a nest where they stay until they are weaned at about 20 weeks of age. Females live for about 3 years, and generally produce one litter.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nGroves, C.P. (2005).  Wilson, D.E.; Reeder, D.M. (eds.).
