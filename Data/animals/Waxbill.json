    "BriefSummary": "Estrildidae, or estrildid finch, is a family of small passerine birds of the Old World tropics and Australasia. They can be classified as the family Estrildidae, comprising species commonly known as munias, mannakins, firefinches, parrotfinches and waxbills, or as a subfamily within the family Passeridae, which strictly defined comprises the Old World sparrows.  Despite the word \"finch\" being included in the common names of many of the species, they are not closely related to birds with this name in other families, such as the Fringillidae, Emberizidae or Passerellidae.\nThey are gregarious and often colonial seed eaters with short, thick, but pointed bills. They are all similar in structure and habits, but vary widely in plumage colours and patterns.\nAll the estrildids build large, domed nests and lay five to ten white eggs. Many species build roost nests. Some of the fire-finches and pytilias are hosts to the brood-parasitic indigobirds and whydahs, respectively.\nMost are sensitive to cold and require warm, usually tropical, habitats, although a few, such as the eastern alpine mannikin, mountain firetail and red-browed finch, and the genus Stagonopleura, have adapted to the cooler climates of southern Australia and the highlands of New Guinea.\nThe smallest species of the family is the Shelley's oliveback (Nesocharis shelleyi) at a mere 8.3 centimetres (3.3 in), although the lightest species is the black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytes) at 6 g (0.21 oz). The largest species is the Java sparrow (Padda oryzivora), at 17 cm (6.7 in) and 25 g (0.88 oz).",

The following scheme may be useful to represent a hypothetical origin in India in the last and stronger Himalayas uplift (16.5 million years ago), when the monsoon rains regime was established in India (see figure). The conclusions from this study are:\n\nEstrildids are a monophyletic group with polytomies that may have started evolving by Middle Miocene Epoch (about 16.5 million years ago)\nThis proposed timing is coincidental with the Fringillinae radiation starting time and also with the biggest Himalayan and Tibetan Plateau uplift, triggered by the Indian tectonic plate strongest collision; this established present day southern Asia monsoon regime and other drastic climatic changes, like drier weather in the Tibetan Plateau and Chinese deserts.\nThe estrildids form a monophyletic group which includes several polytomies and comprises African, Asian and Australian birds.\nThe most ancient evolutive group comprises African (African silverbill), Asian (Indian silverbill) and Australian (diamond firetail); this suggests that the whole Estrildids radiation might have originated around India.\nThe African group Nesocharis is grouped with the African gender Estrilda.\nThe Gouldian finch (Erythrura or Chloebia gouldiae) is definitely included within genus Erythrura with the other species.\nThe Java sparrow (Padda or Lonchura oryzivora) is a very modified species from genus Lonchura: bigger than the rest of Lonchura species, and a noticeable and quite different head pattern. It is endemic to Java, Bali, and the Bawean Islands, although escapes from captivity can be seen today in other neighboring islands.\nAfrican munias (Spermestes) belong to a genus totally different from Australian and Asian munias.\nThe Australian red-browed firetail (Neochmia temporalis), very similar to African common waxbill (Estrilda astrild), is unrelated to it. Their similarities (bill, red brow, etc.) are due to convergent evolution, since their environmental pressures (weather, habitat, feeding) are similar.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nZipcode Zoo: Estrildidae\nInternet Bird Collection.com: Estrildidae videos, photos and sounds\nWaxbill Finch Society \u2014 specialist waxbill bird society based in the UK.",
