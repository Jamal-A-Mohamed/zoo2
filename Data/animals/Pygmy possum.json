    "BriefSummary": "The pygmy possums are a family of small possums that together form the marsupial family Burramyidae. The  five extant species of pygmy possum are grouped into two genera. Four of the species are endemic to Australia, with one species also co-occurring in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.\nPygmy possums range in length from about 5 to 12 cm (2.0 to 4.7 in), and usually weigh between 10 and 50 grams (0.35 and 1.76 oz). They are nocturnal and omnivorous, living on a diet of invertebrates, fruit, seed, nectar and pollen. They are excellent climbers, due in part to their prehensile tails.  Although they cannot glide like some possums, some species can leap long distances.Conservation International (CI) and the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) reported the possible discovery of a new species of Cercartetus pygmy possum upon visit to the Foja Mountains in June 2007.",

Burramys contains only one extant species, the mountain pygmy possum, B. parvus. As currently understood, Cercartetus consists of four extant species.\n\nFamily Burramyidae: pygmy possums\nGenus Burramys\nMountain pygmy possum, B. parvus\n\u2020Burramys wakefieldi\n\u2020Burramys tridactylus\n\u2020Burramys brutyi\nGenus Cercartetus\nLong-tailed pygmy possum, C. caudatus\nWestern pygmy possum, C. concinnus\nTasmanian pygmy possum, C. lepidus\nEastern pygmy possum, C. nanus\u2020 = extinct species\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMikko's Phylogeny Archive",
