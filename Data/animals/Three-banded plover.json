    "WikiContents": "Plovers ( or ) are a widely distributed group of wading birds belonging to the subfamily Charadriinae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThere are about 66 species in the subfamily, most of them called \"plover\" or \"dotterel\".  The closely related lapwing subfamily, Vanellinae, comprises another 20-odd species.Plovers are found throughout the world, with the exception of the Sahara and the polar regions, and are characterised by relatively short bills. They hunt by sight, rather than by feel as longer-billed waders like snipes do. They feed mainly on insects, worms or other invertebrates, depending on the habitat, which are obtained by a run-and-pause technique, rather than the steady probing of some other wader groups.Plovers engage in false brooding, a type of distraction display. Examples include: pretending to change position or to sit on an imaginary nest site.\nA group of plovers may be referred to as a stand, wing, or congregation. A group of dotterels may be referred to as a trip.\n\n\n== Species list in taxonomic order ==\nGenus Anarhynchus\nWrybill, Anarhynchus frontalis\nGenus Charadrius\nCaspian plover, Charadrius asiaticus\nChestnut-banded plover, Charadrius pallidus\nCollared plover, Charadrius collaris\nCommon ringed plover, Charadrius hiaticula\nDouble-banded plover, Charadrius bicinctus\nEurasian dotterel, Charadrius morinellus\nForbes's plover, Charadrius forbesi\nGreater sand plover, Charadrius leschenaultii\nJavan plover, Charadrius (alexandrinus) javanicus\nKentish plover, Charadrius alexandrinus\nKilldeer, Charadrius vociferus\nKittlitz's plover, Charadrius pecuarius\nLesser sand plover, Charadrius mongolus\nLittle ringed plover, Charadrius dubius\nLong-billed plover, Charadrius placidus\nMadagascan plover, Charadrius thoracicus\nMalaysian plover, Charadrius peronii\nMountain plover, Charadrius montanus\nNew Zealand plover, red-breasted plover or New Zealand dotterel, Charadrius obscurus\nOriental plover, Charadrius veredus\nPiping plover, Charadrius melodus\nPuna plover, Charadrius alticola\nRed-capped plover, Charadrius ruficapillus\nRufous-chested plover, Charadrius modestus\nSaint Helena plover, Charadrius sanctaehelenae\nSemipalmated plover,  Charadrius semipalmatus\nSnowy plover, Charadrius nivosus, recently split by the AOU, some other committees still evaluating\nThree-banded plover, Charadrius tricollaris\nTwo-banded plover, Charadrius falklandicus\nWhite-fronted plover, Charadrius marginatus\nWilson's plover, Charadrius wilsonia\nGenus Elseyornis\nBlack-fronted dotterel, Elseyornis melanops\nGenus Oreopholus\nTawny-throated dotterel, Oreopholus ruficollis\nGenus Peltohyas\nInland dotterel, Peltohyas australis\nGenus Phegornis\nDiademed plover, Phegornis mitchellii\nGenus Pluvialis\nAmerican golden plover, Pluvialis dominica \u2013 the American and Pacific golden plovers were formerly considered conspecific (as \"lesser golden plover\"; Sangster et al., 2002)\nEuropean golden plover, Pluvialis apricaria\nGrey plover or black-bellied plover, Pluvialis squatarola\nPacific golden plover, Pluvialis fulva\nGenus Thinornis\nHooded dotterel, Thinornis rubricollis\nShore plover or shore dotterel, Thinornis novaeseelandiae\n\n\n== In folklore ==\nThe European golden plover spends summers in Iceland, and in Icelandic folklore, the appearance of the first plover in the country means that spring has arrived.
