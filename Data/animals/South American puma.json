    "WikiContents": "The South American cougar (Puma concolor concolor) is a cougar subspecies occurring in northern and western South America, from Colombia and Venezuela to Peru, Brazil, Argentina and Chile.\n\n\n== Taxonomic history ==\nInitially, a number of subspecies were described for South America:\nThe type specimen for which Carl Linnaeus described Felis concolor in 1771 was from French Guiana.\nIn 1782, Molina described concolor puma from Chile.\nIn 1940, Puma concolor cabrerae was proposed by Reginald Innes Pocock to be native to northern Argentina.\nIn 1946, concolor capricornensis was described by Goldman from Brazil.As of 2017, the Cat Classification Taskforce of the Cat Specialist Group recognizes only two subspecies: P. c. concolor and P. c. couguar.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nThe cougar preys on birds, deer, sloths, mice, frogs, agoutis, and lizards. Sympatric predators include the spectacled bear, whose cubs the cougar may prey on, and jaguar. In spite of coexisting with the larger jaguar in places like Sangay National Park in Ecuador, the cougar's prey tends to be small. They rarely prey on domesticated animals.In San Guillermo National Park, 80% of the cougar's diet is composed of vicu\u00f1as, while 11% is from mice, and 9% from hares. The cougar also preys on the guanaco. When harassed by Andean condor, they may abandon their kills, which causes them to kill 50% more prey than North American cougars.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe cougar holds historical cultural significance amongst many Southern Native Americans. For example, the cougar's name was used for Incan regions and people.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFlorida panther\nBig cat\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSouth American Cougar",
