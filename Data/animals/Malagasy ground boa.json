This is the largest snake species found on the island of Madagascar. Acrantophis madagascariensis, like others in the family, dispatch their prey by constriction.\nThe color pattern consists of a pale reddish-brown ground color mixed with gray, overlaid with a pattern dorsal rhombs outlined with black or brown.

Previously it was classified as Vulnerable (VU) with the following criteria: A1cd (v2.3, 1994). This means that a population reduction of at least 20% has been observed, estimated, inferred or suspected over the last 10 years or three generations, whichever is the longer, based on a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat, and based on actual or potential levels of exploitation.\nThe species was last assessed in 2011.It is also listed as CITES Appendix I, which identifies it as threatened with extinction and recommends a prohibition in international trade except for scientific research.\n\n\n== Threats ==\nCurrent threats include deforestation, human population growth, agricultural and industrial development, and collection for the illegal pet trade.\n\n\n== Behavior ==\nShelters in mammal burrows, fallen trees, debris piles and similar sites that offer some protection. Brumation takes place during the cool and dry winter months, usually May though July.\n\n\n== Feeding ==\nThe diet consists of small mammals and birds.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\nMating takes place after emerging from brumation.
