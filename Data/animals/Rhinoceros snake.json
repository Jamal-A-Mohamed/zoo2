    "BriefSummary": "The rhinoceros ratsnake (Gonyosoma boulengeri ), also commonly known as the rhinoceros snake, rhino rat snake, and Vietnamese longnose snake, is a species of nonvenomous ratsnake in the family Colubridae. The species is found from northern Vietnam to southern China. It has a prominent, distinctive, scaled protrusion on the front of its snout, which has led to its common naming after a rhinoceros.",
    "WikiContents": "The rhinoceros ratsnake (Gonyosoma boulengeri ), also commonly known as the rhinoceros snake, rhino rat snake, and Vietnamese longnose snake, is a species of nonvenomous ratsnake in the family Colubridae. The species is found from northern Vietnam to southern China. It has a prominent, distinctive, scaled protrusion on the front of its snout, which has led to its common naming after a rhinoceros.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe specific name, boulengeri, is in honor of Belgian-British biologist George Albert Boulenger.\n\n\n== Geographic range ==\nG. boulengeri is found in northern Vietnam including Tam Dao, and in southern China. During a 2001 survey, 10 specimens were observed in Y\u00ean B\u00e1i Province, northern Vietnam.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nAdult size of G. boulengeri is  100\u2013160 cm (39\u201363 in) in total length (including tail). Its scale count includes 19 rows of dorsals at midbody.\n\n\n== Natural history ==\nThe rhinoceros ratsnake inhabits subtropical rainforests at elevations between 300 and 1,100 m (980 and 3,610 ft), particularly valleys with streams. It is generally arboreal,  and mostly nocturnal, hunting small mice and other rodents, birds, and perhaps other vertebrate prey. Oviparous, its mating season from April to May may produce five to 10 eggs in a clutch. After 60 days' incubation, hatchlings are 30\u201335 cm (12\u201314 in) total length, brownish grey with dark edges on several dorsal scales. As they mature, rhinoceros ratsnakes change color to steel grey at about 12\u201314 months, then to a bluish green or green adult hue at about 24 months. However, a rare few individuals maintain their steel grey subadult color and do not pass into ordinarily mature color phase.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBrachtel, Norbert (1998). \"Das Portrait: Rhynchophis boulengeri (Mocquard, 1897)\".
