    "BriefSummary": "The prehensile-tailed porcupines or coendous (genus Coendou) are found in Central and South America. Two other formerly recognized Neotropical tree porcupine genera, Echinoprocta and Sphiggurus, have been subsumed into Coendou, since Sphiggurus was shown by genetic studies to be polyphyletic, while Echinoprocta nested within Coendou.",

Two other formerly recognized Neotropical tree porcupine genera, Echinoprocta and Sphiggurus, have been subsumed into Coendou, since Sphiggurus was shown by genetic studies to be polyphyletic, while Echinoprocta nested within Coendou.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nAmong the most notable features of Coendou porcupines are their unspined prehensile tails.  The front and hind feet are also modified for grasping. These limbs all contribute to making this animal an adept climber, an adaptation to living most of their lives in trees.They feed on leaves, shoots, fruits, bark, roots, and buds. They can be pests of plantation crops. They also make a distinctive \"baby-like\" sound to communicate in the wild.\nYoung are born with soft hair that hardens to quills with age.  Adults are slow-moving and will roll into a ball when threatened and on the ground. The record longevity is 27 years.\n\n\n== Species ==\nGenus Coendou - prehensile-tailed porcupinesBaturite porcupine - C. baturitensis - a newly discovered species\nBicolored-spined porcupine - C. bicolor\nStreaked dwarf porcupine - C. ichillus\nBahia porcupine - C. insidiosus\nBlack-tailed hairy dwarf porcupine - C. melanurus\nMexican hairy dwarf porcupine - C. mexicanus\nBlack dwarf porcupine - C. nycthemera\nBrazilian porcupine - C. prehensilis\nFrosted hairy dwarf porcupine - C. pruinosus\nAndean porcupine - C. quichua\nRoosmalen's dwarf porcupine - C. roosmalenorum\nRothschild's porcupine - C. rothschildi\nStump-tailed porcupine - C. rufescens\nSanta Marta porcupine - C. sanctamartae\nC. speratus - a newly discovered species\nParaguaian hairy dwarf porcupine - C. spinosus\nBrown hairy dwarf porcupine - C. vestitus\n\n\n== References ==\n\nGorbunova, V; Bozzella, MJ; Seluanov, A (September 2008). \"Rodents for comparative aging studies: from mice to beavers\".
