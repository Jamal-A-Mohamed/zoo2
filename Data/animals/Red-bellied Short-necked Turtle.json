    "WikiContents": "The red-bellied short-necked turtle  (Emydura subglobosa), pink-bellied side-necked turtle,  or Jardine River turtle is a species of turtle in the  family Chelidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nTurtle with hard shell, pleurodira, \n\n\n== Geographic range ==\nE. subglobosa is found in Australia and Papua New Guinea.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\nIt lives in lagoons, or lakes.\n\n\n== In captivity ==\nRed-bellied short-necked turtles are popular as pets. A 75-gallon or larger aquarium is used to house this species. In captivity, they feed on fish, commercial turtle pellets and plant matter.\nDue to Australia's ban of exporting wild-caught animals, all wild-caught individuals are from New Guinea. In the United States, Florida had bred these turtles to supply the market. Hong Kong and Taiwan had also bred red-bellied short-necked turtles.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAsian Turtle Trade Working Group 2000.
