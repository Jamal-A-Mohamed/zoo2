They are usually gray-brown with yellowish or white markings, and can reach up to 2 m in length. They are found in Southern Africa, northwards to Angola, Zambia, and Mozambique.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nFirst described by Fran\u00e7ois Marie Daudin in 1802, these lizards were previously classed as a subspecies of Varanus exanthematicus, but have since been declared a distinct species based upon differences in hemipenal morphology.  The generic name Varanus is derived from the Arabic word waral \u0648\u0631\u0644, which is translated to English as \"monitor\".  Their specific name comes from a compound of two Latin words: albus meaning \"white\" and gula meaning \"throat\".\n\n\n== As a pet ==\nThis subspecies is kept as a pet.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWhite-throated monitor, Oakland Zoo\nWhite-throated monitor lizards, Honolulu Zoo",
