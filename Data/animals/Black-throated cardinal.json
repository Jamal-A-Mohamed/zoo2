    "CommonName": "Black-throated cardinal",
    "BriefSummary": "Cardinals, in the family Cardinalidae, are passerine birds found in North and South America. They are also known as cardinal-grosbeaks and cardinal-buntings. \nThe South American cardinals in the genus Paroaria are placed in the Tanager family Thraupidae. Contrariwise, DNA analysis of the genera Piranga (which includes the scarlet tanager, summer tanager, and western tanager), Chlorothraupis, and Habia showed their closer relationship to the cardinal family. They have been reassigned to that family by the American Ornithological Society.",

The family's smallest member is the 12-cm (4.7-in), 11.5-g (0.40-oz) orange-breasted bunting. They are typically associated with open woodland. The sexes usually have distinctive appearances.  The northern cardinal type species was named by colonists for the male's red crest, reminiscent of a Catholic cardinal's biretta.The \"North American buntings\" are known as such to distinguish them from buntings of the Old World family Emberizidae. The name \"cardinal-grosbeak\" can also apply to the cardinalid family as a whole.\nMost species are rated by the IUCN as being of least concern, though some are near threatened.\n\n\n=== Human benefits ===\nA study conducted in 2016 in Atlanta, Georgia, on West Nile virus (WNV) transmission in the United States, found that unlike other species, cardinals biologically suppress the disease upon infection.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nStiles and Skutch, A guide to the birds of Costa Rica ISBN 0-8014-9600-4\nHilty, Steven L (2003) Birds of Venezuela London: Christopher Helm, ISBN 0-7136-6418-5\nffrench, Birds of Trinidad and Tobago ISBN 0-7136-6759-1\n\"National Geographic\" Field Guide to the Birds of North America  ISBN 0-7922-6877-6\nKlicka, John; Burns, Kevin; Spellman, Garth M.
