    "BriefSummary": "The European green toad (Bufo viridis) is a species of toad found in mainland Europe. It lives in many habitats, including steppes, mountainous areas, semi-deserts, and urban areas. The species comprises at least 12 major evolutionary lineages, and there are variations in the color and pattern of this toad across its range. The spots on the back vary from green to dark brown and sometimes red spots appear, too. The underside is white or very lightly coloured.\n\nThe European green toad will change colour in response to heat and light changes. Females are larger than males and can lay 9,000 to 15,000 eggs at a time.\nIt can reach a maximum size (head and body length) of 10 cm (about 4 inches), but growth to this size is rare.",
