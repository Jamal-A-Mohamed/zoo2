    "WikiContents": "Epicrates cenchria is a boa species endemic to Central and South America. Common names include the  rainbow boa, and slender boa. A terrestrial species, it is known for its attractive iridescent/holographic sheen caused by structural coloration. Nine subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nE. cenchria is found in lower Central America (Costa Rica and Panama), and farther south into South America it occurs east of the Andes roughly reaching northern Argentina (in the provinces: Chaco, C\u00f3rdoba, Corrientes, Formosa, Salta, Santiago del Estero and Tucum\u00e1n).\n\n\n== Captivity ==\nDespite requiring very specific humidity and heat, this species is commonly found in the pet trade. \nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, substantial numbers were exported from Suriname. Today, however, far fewer are exported, and most offered for sale are captive bred. Due to their need for high humidity in a captive environment, they should be considered of intermediate difficulty for snake owners, but as long as that is provided they can thrive in captivity. Younger specimens will often bite because of natural defensive instincts, but tend to calm down as they become used to handling.\n\n\n== Subspecies ==\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe subspecific name, barbouri, is in honor of American herpetologist Thomas Barbour.The subspecific name, gaigeae, is in honor of American herpetologist Helen Beulah Thompson Gaige.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of boine species and subspecies\nBoinae by common name\nBoinae by taxonomic synonyms\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEpicrates cenchria at the Reptarium.cz Reptile Database.
