    "WikiContents": "The Atlas beetle (Chalcosoma atlas) is a very large species of beetle in the family Scarabaeidae, found in Southeast Asia. Males have three prominent horns. The species is named for Atlas, the giant of Greek mythology who supported the skies.\n\n\n== Description ==\nChalcosoma atlas, like other beetles of the genus Chalcosoma, is remarkable for its size. As is common in the Scarabaeidae, males are larger than the females, reaching a length of about 60\u2013130 millimetres (2.4\u20135.1 in); females are about 25\u201360 millimetres (0.98\u20132.36 in). Males have specialised horns on their head and thorax that they use to fight with each other, to gain mating rights with females. The Atlas beetle differs from other Chalcosoma species (such as C. caucasus) by the broader end of the cephalic (head) horn.\n\n\n== Larvae ==\nThe larva of the Atlas beetle is known for its fierce behavior, including biting if touched. Unverified reports exist of larvae that live together fighting to the death if they have insufficient space or food.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nC. atlas is found in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n== Parasitoids ==\nThe species is the host of a parasitoid, the giant scoliid wasp Megascolia procer, which has a paralysing venom.\n\n\n== Subspecies ==\nChalcosoma atlas atlas (Linnaeus, 1758)\nChalcosoma atlas butonensis Nagai, 2004\nChalcosoma atlas keyboh Nagai, 2004\nChalcosoma atlas mantetsu Nagai, 2004\nChalcosoma atlas simeuluensis Nagai, 2004\nChalcosoma atlas sintae Nagai, 2004\nChalcosoma atlas hesperus (Erichson, 1834)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Data related to Chalcosoma atlas at WikispeciesBiolib\nKazuo Kawano Character Displacement in Giant Rhinoceros Beetles\nFamily Scarabeidae \u2013 Chalcosoma atlas\nRhinoceros beetles \u2013 Chalcosoma atlas (Atlas beetle)\nChalcosoma atlas (Atlas beetle) photos\nChalcosoma atlas (Atlas beetle) pics\nPhotos of male Atlas beetle",
