    "CommonName": "Red-crested cardinal",
    "BriefSummary": "The red-crested cardinal (Paroaria coronata) is a songbird with a prominent red head and crest. This species belongs in the family of the tanagers (Thraupidae). Notwithstanding its similar name, this bird is not closely related to the true cardinal family (Cardinalidae).\nIt is found in northern Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul and the Pantanal. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry shrubland and heavily degraded former forest. Among other regions, it is found in southern part of the Pantanal.\nIt has also been introduced to Hawaii and Puerto Rico. In Brazil, it has been introduced to various places outside its historical range, as in the Tiet\u00ea Ecological Park in S\u00e3o Paulo, alongside its very similar-looking close relative, the red-cowled cardinal (P. dominicana).The yellow-billed cardinal (P. capitata) could be easily confused with the red-crested cardinal; both the red-cowled and yellow-billed have a very short crest that is not visible except in excited birds, and in the case of the latter, a black throat, darker upper parts and a bright yellow bill.",
