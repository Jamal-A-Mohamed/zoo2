    "BriefSummary": "The Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is a tiger population in Peninsular Malaysia. This population inhabits the southern and central parts of the Malay Peninsula, and has been classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2015. The population was roughly estimated at 250 to 340 adult individuals in 2013, likely comprises less than 200 mature breeding individuals and has a declining trend.When in 1968 Panthera tigris corbetti was designated, the Malayan tiger was included into this subspecies. In 2004, Panthera tigris jacksoni was recognised as a distinct subspecies as a genetic analysis indicated differences in mtDNA and micro-satellite sequences to Panthera tigris corbetti.\nSince revision of felid taxonomy in 2017, the Malayan tiger is recognised as a P. t. tigris population.In the Malay language, the tiger is called harimau, also abbreviated to rimau.",

No type specimen was designated.Malayan tigers appear to be smaller than Bengal tigers. From measurements of 11 males and 8 females, the average length of a male is 8 ft 6 in (259 cm), and of a female 7 ft 10 in (239 cm).\nBody length of 16 female tigers in the State of Terengganu ranged from 70 to 103 in (180 to 260 cm) and averaged 80.1 in (203 cm). Their height ranged from 23 to 41 in (58 to 104 cm), and their body weight from 52 to 195 lb (24 to 88 kg). Data from 21 males in the State of Terengganu showed that total length ranged from 75 to 112 in (190 to 280 cm), with an average of 94.2 in (239 cm). Their height ranged from 24 to 45 in (61 to 114 cm), and their body weight from 104 to 284.7 lb (47.2 to 129.1 kg).\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThe geographic division between Malayan and Indochinese tigers is unclear as tiger populations in northern Malaysia are contiguous with those in southern Thailand. In Singapore tigers were extirpated in the 1950s, and the last one shot in 1932.Between 1991 and 2003, tiger signs were reported from early-succession vegetation fields, agricultural areas outside forests in Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, and Johor, and many riparian habitats outside forests in Pahang, Perak, Kelantan, Terengganu, and Johor. Most of the major rivers that drain into the South China Sea had some evidence of tigers, whereas those draining into the Straits of Malacca in the west did not.Tiger signs were not reported from Perlis, Penang, and Malacca, and the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya in the west coast. The total potential tiger habitat was 66,211 km2 (25,564 sq mi), which comprised 37,674 km2 (14,546 sq mi) of confirmed tiger habitat, 11,655 km2 (4,500 sq mi) of expected tiger habitat and 16,882 km2 (6,518 sq mi) of possible tiger habitat. All the protected areas greater than 402 km2 (155 sq mi) in size had tigers.In September 2014 two conservation organisations announced that a camera trap survey of seven sites in the three separate habitats from 2010 to 2013 had produced an estimate of the surviving population from 250 to 340 healthy individuals, with a few additional isolated small pockets probable. According to the report, the decline meant that the species might have to be moved to the \"Critically Endangered\" category in the IUCN list.\n\n\n== Ecology and behaviour ==\nMalayan tigers prey on sambar deer, barking deer, wild boar, Bornean bearded pigs and serow. Malayan tigers also prey on sun bears, young  elephants and rhino calves. Whether their principal prey includes adult gaur and tapir is unknown. Occasionally, livestock is also taken; however, tiger predation reduces the numbers of wild boar which can become a serious pest in plantations and other croplands. Studies indicate that in areas where large predators (tigers and leopards) are extinct, wild pigs are over 10 times more numerous than in areas where tigers and leopards are still present.Tigers occur at very low densities 1.1\u20131.98 tigers per 100 km\u00b2 in the rainforest as a result of low prey densities, thus to maintain viable tiger populations of minimum of 6 breeding females, reserves need to be larger than 1000 km\u00b2. Information on dietary preference, morphological measurements, demographic parameters, social structure, communication, home range sizes, dispersal capabilities are all lacking.\n\n\n== Threats ==\nHabitat fragmentation due to development projects and agriculture are serious threats.\nCommercial poaching occurs at varying levels in all tiger range states. In Malaysia there is a substantial domestic market in recent years for tiger meat and manufactured tiger bone medicines.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\n\nTigers are included on CITES Appendix I, banning international trade. All tiger range states and countries with consumer markets have banned domestic trade as well.The Malaysian Conservation Alliance for Tigers (MYCAT) is \"an alliance of non-governmental organisations comprising the Malaysian Nature Society (MNS), Traffic Southeast Asia, Wildlife Conservation Society-Malaysia Programme and WWF-Malaysia.\" It also includes the Department of Wildlife and National Parks.In 2007, they implemented a hotline to report tiger-related crimes, such as poaching.  In order to deter poaching, they organize \"Cat Walks\", a citizen patrol in danger zones. MYCAT has a goal of increasing the tiger population.\n\n\n=== In captivity ===\n\nThe Cincinnati Zoo was the first zoo in North America to begin a captive breeding program for Malayan tigers with the importation of a male and three females from Asia between 1990 and 1992. The breeding program was as a Tiger SSP in 1998.\nThere are also a few Malayan Tigers in Zoo Johor, Zoo Negara Kuala Lumpur and Zoo Taiping and Night Safari.\nAs of 2011 there were 54 of this subspecies in North American zoos. The 54 individuals are located in 25 institutions and are descended from only 11 founders. Therefore, the plan of retaining a target of 90% genetic diversity over the next century is not possible unless other founders are added.\n\n\n== Naming controversy ==\nWhen the tiger population of the Malay Peninsula was accepted as a distinct subspecies in 2004, the chairman of the Malaysian Association of Zoos, Parks and Aquaria argued that the new subspecies should be named Panthera tigris malayensis to reflect the geographical region of its range. As a compromise, it received the vernacular name \"Malayan tiger\" and the scientific name Panthera tigris jacksoni, which honours the tiger conservationist Peter Jackson.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nThe Malayan tiger is the national animal of Malaysia.Two tigers are depicted as supporters in the coat of arms of Malaysia, coat of arms of Johor and in the coat of arms of Singapore. The tiger appears in various heraldry of Malaysian institutions such as Royal Malaysia Police, Maybank, Proton and Football Association of Malaysia. It symbolises bravery and strength to Malaysians. It is also the nickname for the Malaysian national football team. The tiger has been given various nicknames by Malaysians, notably \"Pak Belang,\" which literally means \"Uncle Stripes.\" Pak Belang features prominently in folklore as one of the adversaries of Sang Kancil (the mouse deer). The Malayan tiger was featured on Special Service Group insignia and Royal Malay Regiment insignia.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSpecies portrait Panthera tigris and short portrait P. t. jacksoni; IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group\n21st Century Tiger: Tiger Projects Malaysia\nWWF: Malayan tiger\n\"Malaysian Indochinese tiger\" at Kuala Lumpur Zoo",
