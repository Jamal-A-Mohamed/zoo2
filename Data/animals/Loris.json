    "WikiContents": "Loris is the common name for the strepsirrhine primates of the subfamily Lorinae (sometimes spelled Lorisinae) in the family Lorisidae. Loris is one genus in this subfamily and includes the slender lorises, while Nycticebus is the genus containing the slow lorises.\n\n\n== Description ==\nLorises are nocturnal. They are found in tropical and woodland forests of India, Sri Lanka, and parts of southeast Asia. Loris locomotion is a slow and cautious climbing form of quadrupedalism. Some lorises are almost entirely insectivorous, while others also include fruits, gums, leaves, and slugs in their diet.Female lorises practice infant parking, leaving their infants behind in nests. Before they do this, they bathe their young with allergenic saliva that is acquired by licking patches on the insides of their elbows, which produce a mild toxin that discourages most predators, though orangutans occasionally eat lorises.\n\n\n== Taxonomic classification ==\nThe family Lorisidae is found within the infraorder Lemuriformes and superfamily Lorisoidea, along with the family Galagidae, the galagos. This infraorder is a sister taxon of Lemuriformes, the lemurs. Within Lorinae, there are ten species (and several more subspecies) of lorises across two genera:\nFamily Lorisidae\nSubfamily Perodicticinae\nSubfamily Lorinae\nGenus Loris\nGray slender loris, Loris lydekkerianus\nHighland slender loris, L. lydekkerianus grandis\nMysore slender loris, L. lydekkerianus lydekkerianus\nMalabar slender loris, L. lydekkerianus malabaricus\nNorthern slender loris, L. lydekkerianus nordicus\nRed slender loris, L. tardigradus\nDry Zone slender loris, L. tardigradus tardigradus\nHorton Plains slender loris, L. tardigradus nyctoceboides\nGenus Nycticebus\nBangka slow loris, Nycticebus bancanus\nBengal slow loris, N. bengalensis\nBornean slow loris, N. borneanus\nSunda slow loris, N. coucang\nJavan slow loris, N. javanicus\nKayan River slow loris, N. kayan\nPhilippine slow loris, N. menagensis\n\u2020?
