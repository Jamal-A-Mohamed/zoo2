    "CommonName": "Egyptian Fat-tailed Scorpion",
    "BriefSummary": "Fattail scorpion or fat-tailed scorpion is the common name given to scorpions of the genus Androctonus, one of the most dangerous groups of scorpions species in the world. They are found throughout the semi-arid and arid regions of the Middle East and Africa. They are a moderate sized scorpion, attaining lengths of 10 cm (just under 4 in). Their common name is derived from their distinctly fat metasoma, or tail, while the Latin name originates from Greek and means \"man killer\". Their venom contains powerful neurotoxins and is especially potent. Stings from Androctonus species are known to cause several human deaths each year. Several pharmaceutical companies manufacture an antivenom for treatment of Androctonus envenomations.\n\n",

Their venom contains powerful neurotoxins and is especially potent. Stings from Androctonus species are known to cause several human deaths each year. Several pharmaceutical companies manufacture an antivenom for treatment of Androctonus envenomations.\n\n\n== Geographic range ==\nAndroctonus is widespread in North and West Africa, the Middle East and eastwards to the Hindukush region. Countries where Androctonus species live include:  Armenia, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Togo, Palestine, Israel, India, Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Bahrain and Pakistan.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nA rough English translation of the name Androctonus is \"man-killer\", from the Ancient Greek an\u1e17r, andr\u00f3s (\u1f00\u03bd\u03ae\u03c1, \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"man\" and kte\u00ednein (\u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), meaning \"to kill\". Crassicauda means fat-tailed, from the Latin crassus meaning \"thick\" or \"fat\" and cauda, meaning \"tail\". Androctonus crassicauda is widespread throughout the Middle East and its name means \"fat-tailed man-killer\". Similarly, the Latin word for South is australis, from which Androctonus australis, \"southern man-killer\", derives.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nTaxonomic reclassification is ongoing, sources tend to disagree on the number of species.\nAndroctonus Ehrenberg, 1828 (29 species):\n\nAndroctonus aeneas C. L. Koch, 1839*\nAndroctonus afghanus Louren\u00e7o & Qi, 2006*\nAndroctonus aleksandrplotkini Louren\u00e7o & Qi, 2007*\nAndroctonus amoreuxi (Audouin,1826)\nAndroctonus australis (Linnaeus, 1758)\nAndroctonus baluchicus (Pocock, 1900)*\nAndroctonus barbouri (Werner, 1932)*\nAndroctonus bicolor Ehrenberg, 1828\nAndroctonus cholistanus Kovarik & Ahmed, 2013*\nAndroctonus crassicauda (Olivier, 1807)\nAndroctonus dekeyseri Louren\u00e7o, 2005*\nAndroctonus donairei Rossi, 2015*\nAndroctonus eburneus (Pallary, 1928)*\nAndroctonus finitimus (Pocock, 1897)\nAndroctonus gonneti Vachon, 1948*\nAndroctonus hoggarensis (Pallary, 1929)\nAndroctonus liouvillei (Pallary, 1924)*\nAndroctonus maelfaiti Louren\u00e7o, 2005*\nAndroctonus mauritanicus (Pocock, 1902)\nAndroctonus maroccanus Louren\u00e7o, Ythier & Leguin, 2009*\nAndroctonus pallidus Louren\u00e7o, Duhem & Cloudsley-Thompson, 2012*\nAndroctonus robustus Kovarik & Ahmed, 2013*\nAndroctonus santi Louren\u00e7o, 2015*\nAndroctonus sergenti Vachon, 1948\nAndroctonus simonettai Rossi, 2015*\nAndroctonus tenuissimus Teruel, Kovarik & Turiel, 2013*\nAndroctonus tigrai Louren\u00e7o, Rossi & Sadine 2015*\nAndroctonus togolensis Louren\u00e7o, 2008*\nAndroctonus tropeai Rossi, 2015*\n\n\n== In captivity ==\n\nDespite the risks of keeping such a dangerously venomous species in captivity, Androctonus scorpions are frequently found in the exotic animal trade, A. amoreuxi and A. australis being the most commonly available. The fat-tailed scorpion's main diet when in captivity consists of cockroaches, grasshoppers, and crickets. Scorpions will generally try to kill and eat anything which moves and is smaller than themselves. To simulate the desert environment, the enclosure used to keep the scorpion in must be kept at a temperature of between 26 and 30 degrees Celsius (79\u201386 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Scorpion Files: Buthidae\nPhoto of Androctonus habitat in Kuwait\nTreatment of Androctonus stings at eMedicine\nTreatment of Androctonus stings",
