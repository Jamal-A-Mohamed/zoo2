The '''kinkajou''' ({{IPAc-en|'|k|ɪ|ŋ|k|ə|dʒ|uː}} {{respell|KING|kə|joo}}) (''Potos flavus'') is a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical rainforest]] [[mammal]] of the family [[Procyonidae]] related to [[olingo]]s, [[coati]]s, [[raccoon]]s, and the [[Ring-tailed cat|ringtail]] and [[cacomistle]]. It is the [[Monotypic taxon|only member]] of the [[genus]] '''''Potos''''' and is also known as the "honey bear" (a name that it shares with the unrelated [[sun bear]]). Kinkajous are [[arboreal]], a lifestyle they evolved independently; they are not closely related to any other tree-dwelling mammal group (e.g. [[primate]]s, some [[Mustelidae#Ecology|mustelid]]s, etc).

Native to [[Central America]] and [[South America]], this mostly [[Frugivore|frugivorous]] mammal is not an [[endangered species]], though it is seldom seen by people because of its strict [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] habits. However, they are hunted for the pet trade, for their fur (to make wallets and horse [[saddle]]s) and for their meat. The species has been included in Appendix III of [[CITES]] by Honduras, which means that exports from Honduras require an export permit and exports from other countries require a certificate of origin or re-export.<ref>{{cite web
