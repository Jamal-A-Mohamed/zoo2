    "WikiContents": "The white-throated ground dove (Alopecoenas xanthonurus) is a species of ground dove in the genus Gallicolumba.

Future captive-breeding plans are underway.\n\n\n== References ==\nhttp://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/22691037/0 - Retrieved 6 June 2017\nhttp://www.hbw.com/species/white-throated-ground-dove-alopecoenas-xanthonurus - Retrieved 6 June 2017\nhttp://www.mzsdocents.org/monographs/files/white_throated_ground_dove.pdf - Retrieved 6 June 2017Specific",
