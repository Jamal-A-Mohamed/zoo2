    "BriefSummary": "Junonia evarete, the tropical buckeye or West Indian buckeye, is a Neotropical nymphalid butterfly found from Florida and the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, to tropical and subtropical South America. The type locality is Suriname, and numerous subspecies have been described. The synonymy is extensive, and older literature must be used with caution.\nThe butterfly is easily confused with Junonia genoveva, the mangrove buckeye. Not only have the common names mangrove and tropical buckeye been confused, but the two species of butterflies themselves have been sometimes misidentified in past literature. Recent consensus designates Junonia genoveva the mangrove buckeye and Junonia evarete the tropical buckeye.",
