    "BriefSummary": "The red-headed finch (Amadina erythrocephala) (also known as the paradise finch or the red-headed weaver) is a common species of estrildid finch found in Africa. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 1,600,000 km2. It is found in Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.\nMales have vibrant red heads and chests while the females are duller. The resemblance to the cut-throat finch is unmistakable. The red-headed and cut-throat finch are the only members of the genus Amadina. Amadinas with their heavy beaks resemble members of the Lonchura, so they are actually more closely related to the Pytilias such as the Melba finch.",

Estrildinae may have originated in India and dispersed thereafter (towards Africa and Pacific Ocean habitats).\n\n\n== Habits ==\nOften seen in small flocks on dry savannahs, the red-headed finch is a ground feeder which feeds companionably with other species and often visits waterholes. It has a distinctive double-noted chuck-chuck call.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nNewman, K. Newman's Birds of Southern Africa.
