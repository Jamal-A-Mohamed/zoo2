    "BriefSummary": "Partridges are medium-sized non-migratory birds, with a wide native distribution throughout the Old World, including Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa. They are sometimes grouped in the Perdicinae subfamily of the Phasianidae (pheasants, quail, etc.). However, molecular research suggests that partridges are not a distinct taxon within the family Phasianidae, but that some species are closer to the pheasants, while others are closer to the junglefowl.",

Some species are found nesting on steppes or agricultural land, while others species prefer more forested areas. They nest on the ground and have a diet consisting of seeds, grapes and insects. \n\n\n== Hunting ==\nSpecies such as the grey partridge and the red-legged partridge are popular as game birds, and are often reared in captivity and released for the purpose of hunting. For the same reason, they have been introduced into large areas of North America.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nAccording to Greek legend, the first partridge appeared when Daedalus threw his nephew, Perdix, off the sacred hill of Athena in a fit of jealous rage. Supposedly mindful of his fall, the bird does not build its nest in the trees, nor take lofty flights and avoids high places.A famous reference to the partridge is in the Christmas carol, \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\".  The first gift listed is \"a partridge in a pear tree\", and these words end each verse. Since partridges are unlikely to be seen in pear-trees (they are ground-nesting birds) it has been suggested that the text \"a pear tree\" is a corruption of the French \"une perdrix\".The partridge has also been used as a symbol that represents Kurdish nationalism. It is called Kew. Sherko Kurmanj discusses the paradox of symbols in Iraq as an attempt to make a distinction between the Kurds and the Arabs. He says that while Iraqis generally regards the palm tree, falcon, and sword as their national symbols, the Kurds consider the oak, partridge, and dagger as theirs.\n\n\n== Species list in taxonomic order ==\nGenus Lerwa\nSnow partridge, Lerwa lerwa\nGenus Tetraophasis\nVerreaux's monal-partridge, Tetraophasis obscurus\nSzechenyi's monal-partridge, Tetraophasis szechenyii\nGenus Alectoris\nArabian partridge, Alectoris melanocephala\nPrzevalski's partridge, Alectoris magna\nRock partridge, Alectoris graeca\nChukar, Alectoris chukar\nPhilby's partridge, Alectoris philbyi\nBarbary partridge, Alectoris barbara\nRed-legged partridge, Alectoris rufa\nGenus Ammoperdix\nSee-see partridge, Ammoperdix griseogularis\nSand partridge, Ammoperdix heyi\nGenus Perdix\nGrey partridge, Perdix perdix\nDaurian partridge, Perdix dauurica\nTibetan partridge, Perdix hodgsoniae\nGenus Rhizothera\nLong-billed partridge, Rhizothera longirostris\nHose's partridge\u060c Rhizothera dulitensis\nGenus Margaroperdix\nMadagascar partridge, Margaroperdix madagascarensis\nGenus Melanoperdix\nBlack wood-partridge, Melanoperdix nigra\nGenus Xenoperdix\nRubeho forest partridge, Xenoperdix obscuratus\nUdzungwa forest partridge, Xenoperdix udzungwensis\nGenus Arborophila, the hill partridges\nHill partridge, Arborophila torqueola\nSichuan partridge, Arborophila rufipectus\nChestnut-breasted partridge, Arborophila mandellii\nWhite-necklaced partridge, Arborophila gingica\nRufous-throated partridge, Arborophila rufogularis\nWhite-cheeked partridge, Arborophila atrogularis\nTaiwan partridge, Arborophila crudigularis\nHainan partridge, Arborophila ardens\nChestnut-bellied partridge, Arborophila javanica\nGrey-breasted partridge, Arborophila orientalis\nBar-backed partridge, Arborophila brunneopectus\nOrange-necked partridge, Arborophila davidi\nChestnut-headed partridge, Arborophila cambodiana\nRed-breasted partridge, Arborophila hyperythra\nRed-billed partridge, Arborophila rubrirostris\nScaly-breasted partridge, Arborophila chloropus\nChestnut-necklaced partridge, Arborophila charltonii\nSumatran partridge, Arborophila sumatrana\nVietnam partridge, Arborophila merlini\nGenus Caloperdix\nFerruginous partridge, Caloperdix oculea\nGenus Haematortyx\nCrimson-headed partridge, Haematortyx sanguiniceps\nGenus Rollulus\nCrested partridge, Rollulus roulroul\nGenus Bambusicola\nMountain bamboo partridge, Bambusicola fytchii\nChinese bamboo partridge, Bambusicola thoracica\n\n\n== See also ==\nDick Potts, English ecologist and specialist in the partridge.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideos, photos and sounds - Internet Bird Collection",
