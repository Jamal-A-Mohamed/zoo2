    "WikiContents": "The snowy sheathbill (Chionis albus), also known as the greater sheathbill, pale-faced sheathbill, and paddy, is one of two species of sheathbill. It is usually found on the ground. It is the only land bird native to the Antarctic continent.\n\n\n== Description ==\nA snowy sheathbill is about 380\u2013410 mm (15\u201316 in) long, with a wingspan of 760\u2013800 mm (30\u201331 in).

Snowy sheathbills living very far south migrate north in winter.\n\n\n== Feeding ==\nThe snowy sheathbill does not have webbed feet. It finds its food on the land. It is an omnivore, a scavenger, and a kleptoparasite and will eat nearly anything. It steals regurgitated krill and fish from penguins when feeding their chicks and will eat their eggs and  chicks if given the opportunity. Sheathbills also eat carrion, animal feces, and, where available, human waste. It has been known to eat tapeworms that have been living in a chinstrap penguin's intestine.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNeotropical Birds Online A very thorough treatment of the Snowy Sheathbill's distribution, life history, behavior and conservation challenges.",
